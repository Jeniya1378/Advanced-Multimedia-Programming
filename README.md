# 🎧 Advanced Multimedia Programming

This repository contains a series of assignments and experiments related to **audio signal processing** and **image analysis** using Python, NumPy, OpenCV, and other multimedia libraries. The work was developed as part of an Advanced Multimedia Programming course and includes hands-on implementations of concepts such as sine wave generation, spectrograms, zero crossings, RMS analysis, reverberation, and basic image processing.
